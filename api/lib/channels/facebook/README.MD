# FACEBOOK CHANNEL

This connector will allow sending messages between Facebook Messenger and Articulate's agents

## Configuration

1. Create your Facebook app using the [developer console](https://developers.facebook.com/). Once you created your app, you should be in your app dashboard that will look somehow like this:

2. Once in the dashboard, click on the plus sign to add a new product, and then click *Set Up* in the messenger product

3. In the Set Up screen of Messenger, go to the Access Tokens section and select your facebook page, where the agent will be hosted. Once you select it, click on Edit Permissions button and follow the wizard to enable permissions for the page you selected.

4. Now you should have a *Page Access Token* that you need to copy to the details section of the connection, that youâ€™re creating in Articulate

5. For the App Secret value, that is needed to add to your connection, go to the Settings > Basic section in your Facebook app, and then, click in the Show button where the value is. Copy this value and paste it in the connection details tab in Articulate where it goes.

6. Once you copy the value to the Articulate UI, hit the Save button. This will redirect you to the Connection tab where you will see a reference to the address that Facebook will use as webhook URL. You will also see a verify token that is needed to pass to Facebook to verify this URL.

7. Go to your Facebook App again and start to set up the webhook. Go to the Webhooks section in the Messenger product config and hit Subscribe to Events.

8. Copy the values provided by Articulate in the webhook configuration dialog, and enable the subscription for *messages* and *messaging_postbacks*. Then, hit the "Verify and Save" button. Notice that your server will need to be publicly accessible, so Facebook can verify your webhook URL.

9. If your webhook address was verified by Facebook, you should be able to subscribe to your page (the same page of step 3 and 4) to your webhook. Subscribe to it.

10. Verify our page was subscribed as in the following image:

11. Now, you are all set to test your agent by messaging with your account to the facebook page you subscribed to. Please notice that your Facebook app is in development mode. Test it until you are sure you are ready to submit it to review. After Facebook approval, your agent will be publicly available.
